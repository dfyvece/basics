pythagorean

Task: Write a program to solve for c in the pythagorean theorem using SSE packed scalars

Tips:
1) The equation you're solving is sqrt(a^2 + b^2)
2) Used packed scalars to simultaneously square a and b
3) An example of using packed scalars to double 4 numbers is as follows

    movaps xmm0, [ADDRESS_OF_ARRAY_OF_FOUR_FLOATS]      # load arrays into register
    addps xmm0, xmm0                                    # add register with itself
    movaps [ADDRESS_OF_ARRAY_OF_FOUR_FLOATS], xmm0      # all the values in the array are now doubled

4) Addresses need to be 16-byte aligned
5) Useful instructions are:
   movlps xmm0/mem, mem/xmm0        // move two single-precision floats to/from xmm/mem
   addps/subps/mulps/divps/sqrtps   // do parallel operations in arrays
   movss xmm0/mem, mem/xmm0         // move a single-precision floats to/from xmm/mem
   addss/subss/mulss/divss/sqrtss   // do an operation on a register with single value
