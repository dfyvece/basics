Hello World

Task: Write a hello world program using x64 assembly and syscalls

Tips:

1) Put the syscall number in rax
2) If you don't want to lookup the syscall numbers, they are all defined in the include file (include/(gas|nasm).s)
3) The arguments for syscalls is:
    arg1: rdi
    arg2: rsi
    arg3: rdx
    arg4: r10
    arg5: r8
    arg6: r9
4) On x64, syscalls use the 'syscall' instruction and not 'int 0x80'
